# `ext/*`

This folder handles external model implementations, where the code is not easily offered as a package.

Currently, this just includes code for a RetNet, offered as a TorchScale-compatible implementation, or a HuggingFace-compatible implementation.

Comments and attributions are under its `__init__.py`.
